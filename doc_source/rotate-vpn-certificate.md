# Rotating Site\-to\-Site VPN tunnel endpoint certificates<a name="rotate-vpn-certificate"></a>

You can rotate the certificates on the tunnel endpoints on the AWS side by using the Amazon VPC console\. When a tunnel endpointâ€™s certificate is close to expiration, AWS automatically rotates the certificate using the service\-linked role\.
