# Tunnel options for your Site\-to\-Site VPN connection<a name="VPNTunnels"></a>

You use a Site\-to\-Site VPN connection to connect your remote network to a VPC\. Each Site\-to\-Site VPN connection has two tunnels, with each tunnel using a unique virtual private gateway public IP address\. It is important to configure both tunnels for redundancy\. When one tunnel becomes unavailable \(for example, down for maintenance\), network traffic is automatically routed to the available tunnel for that specific Site\-to\-Site VPN connection\.

The following diagram shows the two tunnels of the Site\-to\-Site VPN connection\.

When you create a Site\-to\-Site VPN connection, you download a configuration file specific to your customer gateway device that contains information for configuring the device, including information for configuring each tunnel\. You can optionally specify some of the tunnel options yourself when you create the Site\-to\-Site VPN connection\. Otherwise, AWS provides default values\.

**Note**  
Site\-to\-Site VPN tunnel endpoints evaluate proposals from your customer gateway starting with the lowest configured value from the list below, regardless of the proposal order from the customer gateway\. You can use the `modify-vpn-connection-options` command to restrict the list of options AWS endpoints will accept\. For more information, see [modify\-vpn\-connection\-options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-vpn-connection-options.html) in *Amazon EC2 Command Line Reference*\.

The following are the tunnel options that you can configure\.

**Dead peer detection \(DPD\) timeout**  
The duration, in seconds, after which DPD timeout occurs\. You can specify 30 or higher\.  
Default: 30

**DPD timeout action**  
The action to take after dead peer detection \(DPD\) timeout occurs\. You can specify the following:  
+ `Clear`: End the IKE session when DPD timeout occurs \(stop the tunnel and clear the routes\)
+ `None`: Take no action when DPD timeout occurs
+ `Restart`: Restart the IKE session when DPD timeout occurs
For more information, see [Site\-to\-Site VPN tunnel initiation options](initiate-vpn-tunnels.md)\.

You can specify the tunnel options when you create a Site\-to\-Site VPN connection, or you can modify the tunnel options for an existing VPN connection\. You cannot configure tunnel options for an AWS Classic VPN connection\. For more information, see the following topics:
